Look at my evolution - I wanted to build a full app then I realized that I bit more than I could chew as you can see it in flask_app.md then I revised it so I can focus on core system first and since 
it is a modular system adding the other modules would not be an issue as seen in core system architecture.md or enhanced core system architecture.md. 


"Read CLAUDE.md, progress.md, and todo.md to understand the current state of the project. What should we work on?

 When you come back, just say something like:
  - "Read progress.md and todo.md, let's continue"
  - "What's next on the todo list?"
  - "Let's pick up where we left off"

  I'll read the files and get context on where we are.

## Known Gaps & Technical Debt (2025-12-07)

### High Priority
1. **Bootstrap has no role assignment**
   - First user created via /bootstrap has no admin role
   - Can authenticate but has zero permissions
   - Fix: Create default "admin" role and assign to bootstrap user

2. **Tenant query filter incomplete**
   - `setup_tenant_query_filter()` in middleware.py is simplified
   - May not work for complex queries (joins, subqueries)
   - Needs testing with real queries and potential refinement

### Medium Priority
3. **No tests written**
   - conftest.py and pytest.ini are empty
   - Auth system critical path needs test coverage
   - Tenant isolation needs explicit tests

4. **datetime.utcnow() deprecation**
   - Used in: tenants/models.py, stores/models.py, rbac/models.py, auth/services.py
   - Deprecated in Python 3.12+
   - Replace with: `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`

5. **No health endpoint**
   - `/health` is in middleware exempt paths but not implemented
   - Need basic health check + DB connectivity check

### Low Priority
6. **Empty auth/models.py**
   - File exists but unused
   - Can delete or keep for future auth-specific models (e.g., RefreshToken blacklist)

7. **Marshmallow 4.x edge cases**
   - Using Marshmallow 4.0.1 (newer API)
   - Watch for compatibility issues with examples/tutorials written for 3.x

### Future Considerations
- Permission seeding migration (define actual permissions)
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- Password reset flow
- Email verification flow
- Audit logging for security events

Next up: User Management API endpoints (GET /users/me, PUT /users/me, GET /users) - the foundation for users to
  view and update their profiles.

  Prompt to continue:
  Read progress.md and todo.md, let's implement the User Management endpoints (UserService, user schemas, user
  routes)
